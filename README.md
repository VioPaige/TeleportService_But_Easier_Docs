Hey there fellow developers!

I’ve made a small module that can help new developers/scripters with TeleportService, as I’ve seen on multiple occasions that people are having troubles with it.

How to use the module:

1. Get the module (public roblox model) [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/8462256140/TeleportService-But-Easier)
2. Insert the module in your game
3. Require the module in a script (read this if you don’t know how 2)
4. You can now use the functions mentioned in the docs (replace “TeleportModule” with whatever variable you stored the module      script in)

If you ran into any problems, would like to make a comment, or would like to suggest an update, please let me know!
